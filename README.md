**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform to show you how to build your own clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) in just 30 minutes without writing any backend code.**

*Hacker News is a popular social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. If you’re hacker or work in the startup space, you’ve almost certainly heard of it and perhaps even contribute to it!*

In this project we’ll build a simple version of Hacker News.

In just 30 minutes you’ll learn the basics of Stamplay, including how to:

* register users with Stamplay
* create and manage a database, using Objects

[Here’s what you’ll build](https://hnewsv2.stamplayapp.com/) – all in less than 30 minutes (the user record is 19 minutes). Awesome!
