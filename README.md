stamplay-hackernews
===================

**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform with few lines of [jQuery](http://jquery.com) to show you how to build your own clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) in just 30 minutes.**

*Hacker News is a popular social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. If you’re hacker or work in the startup space, you’ve almost certainly heard of it and perhaps even contribute to it!*

In this project we’ll build a simple version of Hacker News. We haven’t included upvotes or comments but it’s a great starting point if you want to build your own HN.

In just 30 minutes you’ll learn the basics of Stamplay, including how to:

* register users with Facebook
* create and manage a database, using Objects
* create and configure Tasks
* add game mechanics
* send transactional messages (IE Welcome message)
* integrate an third party API (MailChimp)
* use Stamplay web hosting

[Here’s what you’ll build](https://hackernews.stamplayapp.com/) – all in less than 30 minutes (the user record is 19 minutes). Awesome!
